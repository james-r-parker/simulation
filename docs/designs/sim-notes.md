# Simulation notes

**Status:** Reference - verified platform and library facts, and learnings from each phase.

Facts here are verified against the running code or the library source, not recalled. Design docs link here rather
than repeating them.

## Platform

| Fact                                                                                                       | Where it matters           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Node 24 runs the headless sim, the eval runner, the trainer and every test                                 | `package.json` `engines`   |
| npm 11 does not run dependency install scripts unless approved; Vite, Vitest and esbuild work without them | `npm ci` in CI and locally |
| Vite serves `public/` at the site root; `public/database-worker.js` is loaded as `/database-worker.js`     | Workers                    |
| The production site is Cloudflare Pages (`wrangler.toml`, `npm run deploy`)                                | Deployment                 |

## Learned while building

Entries are `### YYYY-MM-DD - <topic>`, newest last, one finding each.

### 2026-10-11 - WebGPU in WSL Chromium is SwiftShader only

Playwright's Chromium under WSL2 (Ubuntu 26.04) gets only the SwiftShader fallback adapter, headless or headed,
whatever the Vulkan and ANGLE flags: Ubuntu's `mesa-vulkan-drivers` ships no Dozen (`dzn`) driver, so there is no
Vulkan device for the GPU. `GPUAdapterInfo` also does not survive `page.evaluate` - copy its fields into a plain
object in the page. Real-GPU browser numbers come from Windows Chrome over CDP (`--cdp=<url>`), which needs WSL
`networkingMode=mirrored` so WSL can reach Windows `127.0.0.1:9222`; Chrome only opens that port with a
non-default `--user-data-dir`.

### 2026-10-11 - Git hooks export GIT_DIR and GIT_INDEX_FILE

Git runs hooks with `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and other `GIT_*` variables set. A test that the pre-commit hook
runs (through `vitest related`) and that spawns `git` in a temporary repository inherits them, so its `git add` and
`git commit` act on the real repository: one wiped the index and committed onto the branch. Tests that spawn `git` or
`scripts/check.sh` pass an environment with every `GIT_*` key removed (`test/check-tiers.test.js`).

### 2026-10-11 - jscpd 5 has no exitCode option

jscpd 5.4.1 has no `exitCode` config key; `threshold: 0` already makes any clone exit 1. Scan paths are passed on
the command line, not in `.jscpd.json`.

### 2026-10-15 - Chromium reproduces the Node golden hashes

Playwright's Chromium 156.0.8078.4 (headless, under WSL2, in a module Web Worker) reproduces both Node 24.21.0 golden
world hashes bit for bit (`default` `9d12e1fdb23244c4`, `busy` `bc456558116b7ed5`, 5000 ticks each, about 3 s per
case), so V8 in Node and in Chromium agree on the sim core's `det-math.js`, `+ - * /` and `Math.sqrt` arithmetic.
`npm run browser:hash` (`scripts/browser-hash.mjs`) re-checks it; hashing needs no GPU, so SwiftShader does not matter.

### 2026-10-15 - Aspire CLI 13.5.4 and the standalone dashboard

Aspire CLI 13.5.4 (`aspire --version`, a dotnet tool, so a login shell) runs the dashboard without Docker:
`aspire dashboard run --frontend-url http://127.0.0.1:18888 --otlp-grpc-url http://127.0.0.1:4317 --otlp-http-url
http://127.0.0.1:4318 --allow-anonymous` (`npm run aspire:dashboard`). Machines with Docker use `docker-compose.yml`:
`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:13.5.2` (the newest 13.5 tag on MCR; the image has no 13.5.4), with the
container ports 18889 (gRPC) and 18890 (HTTP) published as 4317 and 4318; the image leaves the HTTP endpoint off until
`DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` is set (not tried here - Docker is not installed in this WSL).
`scripts/lib/otel.mjs` posted its gauges to the CLI dashboard over OTLP HTTP, and
`GET http://127.0.0.1:18888/api/telemetry/resources` then listed `blob-evolution` with `hasMetrics: true`.

The MCP server is `aspire agent mcp --dashboard-url http://localhost:18888` (registered in `.mcp.json`); it needs no
AppHost. Limitation: its tools are `list_structured_logs`, `list_traces` and `list_trace_structured_logs` only, and
`aspire otel` has `logs`, `spans` and `traces` only, so metrics are viewable in the dashboard UI but not through MCP or
the CLI. Against an unreachable collector `MeterProvider.shutdown` retries past a 5 s test timeout, so `createMetrics`
races it against a 3 s deadline.
