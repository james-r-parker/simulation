# Simulation notes

**Status:** Reference - verified platform and library facts, and learnings from each phase.

Facts here are verified against the running code or the library source, not recalled. Design docs link here rather
than repeating them.

## Platform

| Fact                                                                                                       | Where it matters           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Node 24 runs the headless sim, the eval runner, the trainer and every test                                 | `package.json` `engines`   |
| npm 11 does not run dependency install scripts unless approved; Vite, Vitest and esbuild work without them | `npm ci` in CI and locally |
| Vite serves `public/` at the site root; `public/database-worker.js` is loaded as `/database-worker.js`     | Workers                    |
| The production site is Cloudflare Pages (`wrangler.toml`, `npm run deploy`)                                | Deployment                 |

### 2026-10-11 - WebGPU in WSL Chromium is SwiftShader only

Playwright's Chromium under WSL2 (Ubuntu 26.04) gets only the SwiftShader fallback adapter, headless or headed,
whatever the Vulkan and ANGLE flags: Ubuntu's `mesa-vulkan-drivers` ships no Dozen (`dzn`) driver, so there is no
Vulkan device for the GPU. `GPUAdapterInfo` also does not survive `page.evaluate` - copy its fields into a plain
object in the page. Real-GPU browser numbers come from Windows Chrome over CDP (`--cdp=<url>`), which needs WSL
`networkingMode=mirrored` so WSL can reach Windows `127.0.0.1:9222`; Chrome only opens that port with a
non-default `--user-data-dir`.
