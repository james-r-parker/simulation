        <p><strong>Prepare to be amazed.</strong> Blob Evolution v5.0 isn't just a simulation—it's a window into the
            fundamental processes that created life itself. In this digital petri dish, you'll witness <em>evolution in
                real-time</em>, as simple neural networks bootstrap themselves into complex, intelligent behaviors.</p>

        <p>These aren't scripted animations or pre-programmed behaviors. Every "blob" you see is a learning machine,
            evolving through millions of generations compressed into minutes. What starts as random flailing becomes
            sophisticated strategies: pack hunting, efficient foraging, defensive formations, and even primitive
            communication through pheromone trails.</p>

        <h2>🤯 The Mind-Blowing Science</h2>
        <p>This simulation demonstrates <strong>neuroevolution</strong>—a revolutionary approach where neural networks
            aren't trained on massive datasets, but evolve through Darwinian selection. Each agent has a recurrent
            neural network "brain" that processes sensory input and makes decisions, with the most successful brains
            getting to reproduce.</p>

        <p>The result? <strong>Emergent intelligence</strong>. Behaviors you never explicitly programmed emerge
            naturally: cooperation, specialization, strategic thinking, and adaptive problem-solving. It's artificial
            life that builds its own complexity from the ground up.</p>

        <h2>✨ Revolutionary Features That Push Boundaries</h2>

                <h3>Evolving Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>Every blob has its own <strong>recurrent neural network brain</strong> that learns through evolution,
                    not training data. These mini-AIs develop memory, pattern recognition, and decision-making from
                    scratch—proving that intelligence can emerge from simple rules.</p>

                <h3>Darwinian Selection</h3>
                <p><strong>Natural selection in silicon.</strong> Agents that survive longer, eat more, and reproduce
                    successfully pass their neural architecture to offspring. Random mutations introduce variation,
                    while crossover combines successful traits from multiple parents.</p>

                <h3>GPU-Powered Evolution</h3>
                <p>Running thousands of neural networks simultaneously requires insane computational power. We harness
                    <strong>WebGPU compute shaders</strong> to parallelize the math, achieving real-time evolution at 60
                    FPS that would otherwise crawl at 2 FPS on CPU.</p>

                <h3>Photorealistic Vision</h3>
                <p>Agents "see" using <strong>GPU-accelerated ray tracing</strong>—the same technology powering modern
                    video games. Each blob casts dozens of rays to detect food, predators, obstacles, and potential
                    mates with photographic precision.</p>

                <h3>Emergent Specialization</h3>
                <p>Watch as evolution naturally creates <strong>diverse roles</strong>: stealthy hunters that ambush
                    prey, efficient foragers that maximize energy return, defensive guardians that protect the colony,
                    and social coordinators that organize group movements.</p>

                <h3>Persistent Digital Life</h3>
                <p>Your evolved species don't die when you close the browser. <strong>IndexedDB</strong> preserves the
                    most successful neural architectures, allowing you to continue evolving the same lineages across
                    sessions and even share them with others.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic Environments</h3>
                <p>The world isn't static—food spawns adapt to population pressure, seasonal scarcity challenges
                    survival strategies, and pheromone communication enables primitive social behaviors. Evolution never
                    stops adapting.</p>

            <div class="feature-card">

                <h3>Real-Time Analytics</h3>
                <p>Watch evolution metrics live: fitness curves, population dynamics, specialization ratios, energy
                    efficiency, and genetic diversity. It's like having a window into the evolutionary process itself.

        <h2>🎯 What Makes This Different?</h2>
        <p>Most AI demos show pre-trained models or scripted behaviors. This simulation creates <strong>intelligence
                from scratch</strong> through the same processes that created life on Earth. You're not watching a
            program—you're watching creation unfold.</p>

        <p>The implications are profound: if simple neural networks can evolve complex behaviors, what does that say
            about the nature of intelligence, learning, and adaptation? This isn't just a tech demo—it's a philosophical
            exploration of emergence and evolution.</p>
